Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning classifiers. The dataset used is creditcard.csv, which contains transaction data.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare several machine learning models to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Environment Setup
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
sklearn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
Development Environment:
The code is developed and tested in Google Colab, leveraging its integration with Google Drive for dataset access.
Dataset Overview
Loading and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and initial exploration includes displaying the first and last five rows of data, checking dataset information, and identifying missing values.
Data Distribution:

Analysis of the distribution of normal and fraudulent transactions to understand class imbalance.
Data Preprocessing:

Undersampling of the majority class (normal transactions) to create a balanced dataset for training machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models
Several classification models are implemented and evaluated:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Implementation of KNN for classification and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Logistic Regression:

Utilization of Logistic Regression for binary classification and evaluation of model performance.
Decision Tree:

Implementation of Decision Trees with optimization for maximum recall, visualizing the decision-making process.
Bagging Classifier (based on Logistic Regression):

Application of Bagging Classifier with Logistic Regression as the base estimator, evaluating ensemble model performance.
Random Forest Classifier:

Implementation of Random Forest Classifier to leverage ensemble learning for improved classification accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics
Performance of each model is evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and various metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall.
Conclusion
This project provides insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for detecting credit card fraud. It aims to showcase how data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics play crucial roles in developing robust fraud detection systems.
